Abstract

   WORK IN PROGRESS - SEPTEMBER 2019

   Onion networking [RFC7686] offers technical features which obviate
   many of the risks upon which led to the development of our modern
   Certificate Authority Public Key Infrastructure; as an increasingly
   popular technology for networking with strong trust requirements,
   onion networking would benefit from easier access to TLS certificates
   for HTTPS use.

   At the moment only EV certificates are available for onion network
   addresses, although DV certificates are under discussion.  This
   document defines a third mechanism - SOOC: Same Origin Onion
   Certificates - which would enable real-time, client-side validation
   of per-onion-address TLS certificates, fully equivalent (in defined
   circumstances) to validation of a certificate trust chain, but
   involving none of third parties, trust chains, or financial cost.

1.  Introduction

   There are many reasons why the Internet and WWW are equipped with a
   public key infrastructure (PKI), and the PKI offers many features and
   benefits; however its inarguable primary function is to provide a
   form of identity assurance, that when a person types a hostname such
   as "www.example.com" into a web browser's URL bar, they should have
   some reasonable expectation - and ideally a strong guarantee - that
   the network-connected-service from which they are eventually served
   content is one that would commonly be accepted as being capable,
   permitted and expected to serve content which people who own the
   "www.example.com" intentionally supply.

   The PKI mechanism has evolved to provide such identity assurance in a
   heavily-layered network environment which lacks overarching trust

   mechanisms and which is riven with potential for attack at (or:
   across) different layers.

   For instance:

   *  ARP: first-hop, last-hop, or indeed any other hop may be hijacked
      with spoofed layer-2 address resolution; indeed some firewall
      devices rely upon this mechanism for their function

   *  TCP: traffic may be blocked, dropped, modified, injected, or
      redirected to fake machines

   *  BGP: bearer traffic and entire flows may be blocked, dropped, or
      redirected to fake machines

   *  DNS: namespaces can be domain-jacked, responses can be forged,
      cache-poisoned, or simply tampered-with in flight, also homoglyph
      "lookalike" domains (eg: www.examp1e.com) are also possible

   The benefits of any intra-layer trust mechanism - eg: IPsec
   Authentication Header (AH) & Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) at
   layer-3 - are typically isolated and not known to other layers of the
   stack - eg: the web browser - which therefore cannot take
   consideration of their benefits.

   In this environment our HTTPS ecosystem has evolved in the
   expectation of ignoring transport security - such as IPsec - and has
   instead has built its own, where a server's "identity" may be
   provisionally bootstrapped by DNS resolution of of a layer-3 IP
   address, however that identity MUST be proven by proof-of-possession
   of a cryptographic key that has been blessed by a trusted authority
   as pertaining to "www.example.com".

   The extent of such blessing is variable: for DV certificates the
   requisite test is one of consistent DNS resolution (eg: LetsEncrypt);
   and for EV certificates there are additional, expensive, and arguably
   superfluous corporate identity checks.

1.1.  Onion Networking compared to TLS PKI

   Tor "onion networking" is an alternate, software-defined, flat
   layer-3 network space which exists on top of TCP/IP and the rest of
   the internet.

   Onion addresses are either hashes of (in 80-bit version 2 addresses),
   or are literally and entirely (in 256-bit version 3 addresses) the
   public keys which sign all data that pertains to communication with
   that address.

   Like most cryptographic keys, onion addresses appear essentially to
   be strings of random bits, although it's possible via "mining" to
   eventually generate one which appears meaningful to human beings, eg:
   "facebookcorewwwi.onion"

   For purposes of PKI, the most interesting aspect of onion addresses
   is their textual representation; unlike IPv4's "dotted quads" or
   IPv6's colon-separated hexadecimal, onion addresses are required
   ([RFC7686] section 1) to be written in a DNS-compatible text format:
   as base-32 encoded binary with addition of the IANA Special-Use
   Domain Name suffix, ".onion", and they are interpreted ignoring any
   labels other than the rightmost two.

   Thus: the onion address "www.exampleonionaddr.onion" would be a
   version 2 onion address representing a server that possesses a
   1024-bit RSA public key which has an 80-bit-truncated SHA-1 hash of
   0x25c0c7ac8e6a1cd00c71 ([RFC3548] base32 "EXAMPLEONIONADDR"); and
   where the "www" prefix hostname/subdomain will ignored, although if
   specified it will be passed onward in an HTTPS "Host:" header.

   This representation pierces all of the layers of the network stack,
   and in one encoding it addresses most of the problems which the TLS
   PKI stack has gradually evolved to solve for TCP/IP:

   *  There is no DNS name resolution service in onion networking, and
      in fact [RFC7686] section 2 specifies that there MUST NOT be
      overlap with DNS; this is an important point to which we will
      return later.

   *  What the user types into the browser bar will defacto prove what
      site they are connected to; the Tor Onion Network at layer 3 will
      consequently assert "proof-of-possession of a cryptographic key"
      that will correspond absolutely to the remote service; this is
      isomorphic to the model of a TLS certificate proving the identity
      of a webserver.

   *  Because onion addresses are layer-3 addresses, there is no concept
      of "subdomains" nor of "hostnames" and therefore any such
      information is considered "advisory"; however in this format they
      are backwards compatible in a way that "subdomains" for "dotted
      quad" addresses would not be, eg: "www.192.168.1.1"

   *  All other connectivity redirections or "hijacks" are inhibited by
      the Tor network stack.

2.  SOOC In Context

   As described above, the security characteristics and protections of
   layer-3 networking (eg: IPsec) are generally not visible to HTTPS
   applications at layer-7, and therefore cannot be relied upon.

   However: the encoding of onion addresses explicitly solves this
   problem:

   *  The connection MUST be an onion connection, because it was made
      using Tor-capable software, and because the ".onion" Special Use
      Domain Name is reserved for that purpose.

   *  The connection MUST be to "exampleonionaddr.onion" because the Tor
      network will not permit otherwise.

   *  Any subdomain or hostname is subordinate to the fact that the
      connection is made to "exampleonionaddr.onion", because (as a
      layer-3 address) there are actually no such things as "subdomains"
      or "hostnames", and thus this information is purely advisory, or
      for compatability.

   Therefore it is possible for a client to assure itself - when
   presented with a TLS certificate for "www.exampleonionaddr.onion" -
   to assure itself that it is genuinely and authoritatively connected
   to "exampleonionaddr.onion" by simply performing a string comparison
   with the hostname to which is it connected - without any reference to
   a certificate authority trust chain nor any other third party
   resource.

   This observation is the basis of "Same Origin Onion Certificate"
   checking; that onion sites may offer (eg: homebrew DV-compliant) TLS
   certificates which correspond solely and uniquely to themselves, and
   under those limited circumstances the client may skip the certificate
   chain checks that might otherwise be required to validate identity.
